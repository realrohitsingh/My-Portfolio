# Vercel Deployment Guide

## ✅ Your Portfolio is Ready for Vercel Deployment!

### 🚀 Quick Deployment Steps:

1. **Push to GitHub** (if not already done):

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Ready for deployment"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Deploy on Vercel**:
   - Go to [vercel.com](https://vercel.com)
   - Sign in with GitHub
   - Click "New Project"
   - Import your repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect it's a Vite project
   - Click "Deploy"

### 🖼️ Images Will Work Perfectly!

✅ **Profile images are properly configured**:

- Images are imported correctly using ES6 imports
- Vite processes and optimizes them during build
- They're included in the `dist/assets/` folder
- Build output shows: `dist/assets/profile-Bz7xFRJY.jpg`

### 📧 EmailJS Configuration:

Your contact form will work with the current hardcoded values, but for better security:

1. **Optional**: Create environment variables in Vercel dashboard:

   - `VITE_EMAILJS_SERVICE_ID`: service_cu2htwo
   - `VITE_EMAILJS_TEMPLATE_ID`: template_lrmfutk
   - `VITE_EMAILJS_USER_ID`: Pxl45pIUX0tZmpwa1

2. **Current setup works without environment variables** (fallbacks included)

### 🎯 What's Included:

- ✅ **vercel.json**: Optimized configuration
- ✅ **Build optimization**: Assets properly processed
- ✅ **SPA routing**: All routes redirect to index.html
- ✅ **Caching**: Static assets cached for performance
- ✅ **Image optimization**: Profile images will load correctly

### 🔧 Build Configuration:

- **Framework**: Vite (auto-detected)
- **Build Command**: `npm run build`
- **Output Directory**: `dist`
- **Node Version**: Latest (auto-detected)

### 🎉 Ready to Deploy!

Your portfolio is fully optimized and ready for Vercel deployment. All images, animations, and functionality will work perfectly in production!
